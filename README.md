# nb-nebi-kernels

A custom Jupyter `KernelSpecManager` that automatically discovers local and remote [Nebi](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebi)-tracked [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) workspaces and exposes each environment as a Jupyter kernel.

## How it works

1. Discovers locally-tracked workspaces via `nebi workspace list --json`.
2. Optionally discovers additional local workspaces from configured roots.
3. Optionally discovers remote workspaces from the Nebi API using `NEBI_REMOTE_URL` and `NEBI_AUTH_TOKEN`.
4. Enumerates environments per workspace (`pixi info --json` for local workspaces, remote `pixi.toml` parsing for remote-only workspaces).
5. Classifies each kernel into a structured state (`ready`, `outdated`, `remote-not-pulled`, `local-not-installed`, `local-missing-deps`).
6. Launches each installed kernelspec's own command via `pixi run --frozen` with environment isolation.
7. Provides `POST /nb-nebi-kernels/kernels/refresh` for consumers to invalidate the discovery cache after Nebi workspace changes.

## Installation

```bash
pip install nb-nebi-kernels
```

That's it — the kernel spec manager is automatically configured when installed into your JupyterLab environment.

### Prerequisites

- [Nebi CLI](https://github.com/nebari-dev/nebi) on your PATH
- [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/) on your PATH
- At least one tracked nebi workspace (`nebi init` in a pixi project)
- For remote discovery: `NEBI_REMOTE_URL` and `NEBI_AUTH_TOKEN`

## Usage

Once installed, any nebi-tracked pixi workspace appears as a kernel in JupyterLab or Notebook:

- A workspace `data-science` with environments `default` and `gpu` shows as two kernels: **data-science (default)** and **data-science (gpu)**
- A workspace `web-app` with only the default environment shows as just **web-app**
- A remote-only workspace can still appear as a kernel (state: `remote-not-pulled`) before it is pulled locally
- Python, R, Julia, xeus, and other kernels work generically through their installed `kernel.json`.
- If one pixi environment contains multiple kernelspecs, the primary keeps the existing kernel name and additional kernels get deterministic suffixes.

If discovery returns no workspaces, Jupyter falls back to its default kernels. If workspaces are discovered but local tools/dependencies are missing, kernels are surfaced as non-ready instead of crashing.

## Configuration

Optional behavior can be configured through environment variables and traitlets.

### Environment variables

- `NEBI_REMOTE_URL`: Base Nebi server URL used for remote workspace discovery.
- `NEBI_AUTH_TOKEN`: Bearer token used for Nebi API requests.
- `NEBI_WORKSPACE_DISCOVERY_PATHS`: Extra local workspace roots, separated by the OS path separator (`:` on Linux/macOS, `;` on Windows).

### Traitlets

```python
# Example in jupyter_server_config.py
c.NebiKernelSpecManager.workspace_discovery_roots = ["/mnt/shared/nebi-workspaces"]
c.NebiKernelSpecManager.required_launch_dependencies = ["optional-extra-package"]
```

- `workspace_discovery_roots` adds local discovery roots (in addition to `nebi workspace list` results).
- `required_launch_dependencies` optionally adds package checks beyond the installed Jupyter kernelspec. Default: `[]`.
- `discovery_cache_ttl_seconds` controls how long discovery results are cached. Default: `30`.

### Refresh endpoint

Clients that install, pull, or otherwise change Nebi workspaces can make an authenticated Jupyter Server request to refresh kernelspec discovery:

```text
POST /nb-nebi-kernels/kernels/refresh
```

The endpoint invalidates the `NebiKernelSpecManager` discovery cache, so the next kernelspec request recomputes available Nebi kernels immediately.

## Kernel states and metadata

Each generated kernelspec includes state metadata for UI consumers.

| `nebi_state` | Meaning | Launch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ready` | Local workspace/env is installed and dependencies are satisfied. | Allowed |
| `outdated` | Local and remote versions differ. | Allowed |
| `remote-not-pulled` | Workspace exists remotely but has no local path yet. | Blocked |
| `local-not-installed` | Local environment is not installed/materialized. | Blocked |
| `local-missing-deps` | Local environment is missing required dependencies or a Jupyter kernelspec. | Blocked |

Important metadata fields:

- `nebi_state`, `nebi_not_ready_reason`, `nebi_missing_dependencies`
- `nebi_local_version`, `nebi_remote_version`, `nebi_outdated`
- `nebi_discovery_hash`, `nebi_discovered_at`

Stable `nebi_not_ready_reason` values include:

- `workspace-not-pulled`
- `missing-dependencies`
- `kernel-not-installed`
- `local-version-behind-remote`
- `environment-not-installed`
- `workspace-missing`
- `manifest-missing`
- `pixi-missing`
- `pixi-timeout`
- `pixi-list-failed`
- `pixi-json-parse-failed`

## Development

# Install dev dependencies
pixi install -e dev

# Run tests
pixi run test

# Run tests with coverage
pixi run test-cov

# Run linting
pixi run lint

# Format code
pixi run format

- **discovery.py** — Parses local `nebi workspace list --json`, optionally discovers remote workspaces through the Nebi API, resolves environment names, and probes local env install/dependency health.
- **launcher.py** — Clears `PIXI_*` environment variables, blocks non-launchable states with actionable stderr messages, then execs `pixi run` in the workspace directory.
- **manager.py** — Subclasses `KernelSpecManager`, merges local and remote workspace views, classifies per-kernel state, and emits structured kernelspec metadata.
- **server_extension.py** — Registers the authenticated kernel discovery cache refresh endpoint.
